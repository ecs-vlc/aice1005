\section[-1]{String Matching}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Algorithms for strings are a major research area sometimes known
    as \emph{stringology}\pause
  \item The prototypical problem is that you have
    \begin{itemize}
    \item some text $\bf{T}=T_1 T_2 \cdots T_n$
    \item some pattern $\bf{P}=P_1 P_2 \cdots P_m$
    \item you want to find an exact match between the pattern and text\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item Variants on this problem are to find \emph{regexp} matches and
    inexact matches (see compiler course next year)\pause
  \item Application in everything from a simple editor to biological
    sequence analysis\pause
  \end{itemize}

\section[-0.5]{Strategies for Exact String Matching}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The simplest strategy is a brute force strategy where the
    pattern is tested at each location in the text---this leads to an
    $O(n\times m)$ algorithm\pause
  \item A more sophisticated strategy is to preprocess the pattern to
    reduce unnecessary comparisons, this can reduce the worst case time
    to $O(n)$\pause
  \item If performing many comparisons a more sophisticated strategy is
    to preprocess the text---this can give very significant
    speed-ups\pause
  \item The state-of-the-art techniques are known as suffix trees and
    suffix arrays (they are containers holding all suffixes)\pause
  \end{itemize}

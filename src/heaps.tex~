\section[-1]{Priority Queues}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item One of the prime uses of heaps is to implement a priority
    queue\pause
  \item A Priority Queue is a queue with priorities\pause
  \item That is, we assign a priority to each element we add\pause
  \item The head of the queue is the element with highest priority
    (smallest number)\pause
  \item Used, for example, in simulating real time events\pause
  \item Used to implement ``greedy algorithms''\pause

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A simple Priority Queue might include
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{unsigned size()} returning the the number of
      elements
    \item \texttt{bool empty()} returns true if empty
    \item \textit{void add(T element, int priotiry)} adds an element
      (in STL this is known as \texttt{push})
    \item \texttt{T getMin()} returns head of queue (in STL this is
      called \texttt{top})
    \item \texttt{T removeMin()} dequeues head of queue (in STL this
      is known as \textit{pop}, but it does not return the element)

\section{Time Complexity of Heaps}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The two important operation are \texttt{add} and
    \texttt{removeMin}\pause
  \item These both either percolating an element up the tree or
    percolating an element down the tree\pause
  \item The number of operations depends on the depth of the tree which
    is $\Theta(\log(n))$\pause
  \item Thus \texttt{add} and \texttt{removeMin} are $O(\log(n))$\pause
  \item Except \texttt{add} could also require resizing the
  array\pause\nhl{,} but the amortised cost of this is low\pause

\section[-1]{Real Time Simulation}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A nice application of priority queues is to perform real time
    simulations\pause
  \item I was once modelling a neural network where neuron fired an
    impulse which would then be received by other neurons\pause

\begin{slide}
\section{Synchronised Firing}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We wanted to show that if a group of neurons fired together they
    could make another group of neurons fire in synchrony despite the
    fact that it would take different times for the receiving neurons to
    feel the pulse (due to the different lengths of the axons)\pause
  \item A famous Israeli group had ``proved'' this couldn't happen\pause
  \item Using a priority queue we modelled the neurons
    \begin{itemize}
    \item When a neuron fired the receiving neurons would be put on a
      priority queue according to when they received the pulse\pause
    \item If the receiving neurons received enough pulse in a short
      enough time they would then fire\pause
    \end{itemize}

\begin{slide}
\section{Efficient Modelling}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Using a priority queue meant we knew when the next event would
    happen\pause
  \item We did not have to run a clock where most of the time nothing
    happened\pause
  \item This allowed us to perform a very large simulation efficiently\pause
  \item The simulation showed that the pulse of neurons synchronised
    despite the ``proof'' that this wouldn't happen\pause

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section[-1]{Heap Sort}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A priority queue suggests a very simple way of performing
    sort\pause
  \item We simply add elements to a heap and then take them off
  again
  \begin{java}
    template <typename T>
    void sort(vector<T> aList)
    {
        HeapPQ<T> aHeap = new HeapPQ<T>(aList.size());$\pause$
        for (T element: aList)
          aHeap.push(element, element);$\pause$

        aList.clear();$\pause$
        while(aHeap.size() > 0) {
          aList.push_back(aHeap.top());
          aHeap.pop();
        }
    }$\pause$
  \end{java}
  \item Note that this is not an in-place sort algorithm (i.e. it uses
    lots of memory)\pause

\section[-2]{Complexity of Heap Sort}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item As we have to add $n$ elements and then remove $n$ elements the
    time complexity is log-linear, i.e. $O(n\,\log(n))$\pause\vspace*{-1cm}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[height=12cm]{heapSortTimings}\pause

\begin{slide}
\section{Other Heaps}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Binary Heaps are so useful that other types of heaps have been
    developed\pause
  \item The simplest enhancement is to combine a binary heap with a map
    which maintains a pointer to each element\pause
  \item The map has to be updated every time elements are moved in the
    heap (fortunately only $O(\log(n))$ elements are move each time the
    heap is updated)\pause
  \item The advantage of this heap is that the priorities of elements
    can be changed (involving percolating elements up or down the tree)\pause

\section{Merging Heaps}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item One common demand on a heaps is to merge two heaps\pause
  \item Unfortunately binary heaps are not efficiently merged\pause
  \item There are a variety of different heaps (leftist heaps, skew
    heaps, binomial queues, \ldots) designed to be merged\pause
  \item All these heaps are real binary trees (i.e. represented by
    pointers rather than put in an array)\pause
  \item They are slower than a binary heap because indexing is slightly
    slower as is creating node objects\pause
  \item However, they allow merging\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section{Other Operations}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item All other operations are achieved by merging
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Adding an element is achieved by merging the current heap with
      a heap of one element\pause
    \item Removing the minimum element is achieved by removing the root
      and merging the left and right tree\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item For details see the course text (you won't be examined on the
    details of these heaps)\pause

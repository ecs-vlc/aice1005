<h1>Lab A4: Huffman Coding</h1>

<p>Your task in this is to write code to read
this <a href="study.txt">file</a>, encode it using a Huffman code and
decode it using a Huffman tree.

  <ol>
    <li> Start by writing some code to read a file and count the number of occurrences of each character.  If you are struggling the code to do this is <a href="charCount.cc">here</a>.</li>
    <li> The next task is to write a Huffman tree. C++ allows us to use inheritance.  It is useful to have an base class <code>HuffmanTree</code> and two derived classes <code>HuffmanTreeLeaf</code> and <code>HuffmanTreeNode</code>.  We show an example of how to do this below.  You will want to add additional functions and you need to fill in the constructors for the leaf node and non-leaf node.
      <pre><code>
	  /* Abstract base class for Huffman tree */
	  class HuffmanTree {
	  protected:
	    unsigned occurrence_frequency;
	  public:
	    int occurrence()  const {return occurrence_frequency;}
	    ...
	  };

	  /* Leaf node for Huffman tree */
	  class HuffmanTreeLeaf: public HuffmanTree {
	  private:
	    char character;

	  public:
	    HuffmanTreeLeaf(char ch, int occ) {
	      ...
	    }
	    ...
	  };

	  /* Non-leaf node */
	  class HuffmanTreeNode: public HuffmanTree {
	  private:
	    HuffmanTree* left_child;
	    HuffmanTree* right_child;
	  public:
	    HuffmanTreeNode(HuffmanTree* left, HuffmanTree* right) {
	      ...
	    }
	    ...
	  };
      </code></pre>
      To use this kind of inheritance you use pointers to the HuffmanTree base class, but initialise the derived class, e.g.
      <pre><code>
	  HuffmanTree* ht1 = new HuffmanTreeLeaf('a', 50);
	  HuffmanTree* ht2 = new HuffmanTreeLeaf('b', 30);

	  HuffmanTree* = new HuffmanTreeNode(ht1, ht2);
      </code></pre>
    <li> We now have to build a Huffmann tree.  To do this we have to create a <code>HuffmanTreeLeaf</code> for each character in <code>charCount</code> (our map of characters).  These should be added to a priority queue (using <code>pq.push(new HuffmanTree(ch, occ)</code>).  For the priority queue to sort the <code>HuffmanTree</code>s correctly we have to define a comparison class
      <pre><code>
	  /* class used to sort Huffman subtrees */
	  class CompareHuffman {
	  public:
	    bool operator()(HuffmanTree* ht1, HuffmanTree* ht2) {
	      return ht1-&gt;occurrence() > ht2-&gt;occurrence();
	    }
	  };
      </code></pre>
      Priority queues are defined in the header file <code>queue</code>.  To define a priority queue we use
      <pre><code>
	  priority_queue&lt;HuffmanTree*, vector&lt;HuffmanTree*&gt;, CompareHuffman&gt; pq;
      </code></pre>
    <li> Having pushed all the characters onto the priority queue we need to take out the top pair (using <code>top()</code> and <code>pop()</code> twice) and create a new <code>HuffmanTreeNode*</code> that we then push onto the priority queue.  We repeat this until there is only one <code>HuffmanTree*</code> left in the priority queue.  This points to the root of the complete Huffman tree.
    <li> We now have to traverse the Huffman tree from the root to all the leaves to extract all the codes.  To do this define a map which will contain all the codes
      <pre><code>
	  map&lt;char, string&gt; codeMap;
      </code></pre>
      You need to write a function <code>extractCodes</code> which needs to be a virtual function in your base class (making it virtual forces you to define it in the derived classes)
      <pre><code>
	  /* Defined in HuffmanTree */
	  virtual void extractCodes(map&lt;char, string&gt;& codeMap, string codeString) const = 0;
      </code></pre>
      We define it as <code>const</code> because it should not change the data stored in the Huffman tree nodes.  Setting it equal to 0 means we don&#39;t give it an implementation in the base class. We have to define the same function in the derived classes
      <pre><code>
	  /* Defined in HuffmanTreeLeaf and HuffamnTreeNode */
	  void extractCodes(map&lt;char, string&gt;& codeMap, string codeString) const {
	    ...
	  }
      </code></pre>
      We can populate the <code>codeMap</code> recursively using a single call to the HuffmanTree (which I've called root)
      <pre><code>
	  root-&gt;extractCodes(codeMap, "");
      </code></pre>
      For the <code>HuffmanTreeNode</code> we recursively call <code>extractCodes</code> on the <code>left_child</code> and <code>right_child</code>.  For the left child you need to extend <code>codeString</code> by "0" for the right child you extend it with "1".  For the <code>HuffmanTreeLeaf</code> you just use <code>codeMap[character] = codeString;</code> (this creates a mapping from the character stored in the leaf to a codestring).  As a sanity check you can look at your codes
      <pre><code>
	  cout &lt;&lt; "Huffman Encoding\n";
	  for(auto&amp; code: codes) {
            cout &lt;&lt; "\"" &lt;&lt; code.first &lt;&lt; "\": " &lt;&lt; code.second &lt;&lt; endl;
          }
          cout &lt;&lt; "---------------------\n";
      </code></pre>
      (note that some characters are unprintable and one is the return character).
    <li>We can now use our <code>codeMap</code> to encode our file.  We can do this with the following code
      <pre><code>
	  /* Encode the text using Huffman tree */
	  file.clear();             // clean up file stream for the input text
	  file.seekg(0);            // start from beginning
  
	  string encoded_text_filename = "encoded_text.txt";
	  ofstream encoded_file(encoded_text_filename);    // file we will write to
	  int length=0;                                    // measure length of encoding
	  while (file.get(ch)) {
	    string code = codeMap[ch];                     // use map to get new encodings
	    encoded_file &lt;&lt; code;
	    length += code.size();
	  }
	  cout &lt;&lt; "length of encoding = " &lt;&lt; length/8 &lt;&lt; " bytes\n";
          cout &lt;&lt; "---------------------\n";
          encoded_file.close();
      </code></pre>
      I got a code length for the file of 140430 bytes.  Note that if you really wanted to compress the file you would print using a byte encoding (rather than write 0 and 1 in ACCII).
    <li> One last piece of code is to use the Huffman tree to decode encoded text file.  We read the encoded text one character at a time.  We set a <code>HuffmanTree*</code> to root and then pass the character (0 or 1) to a function <code>HuffmanTree* decode(char)</code> of the HuffmanTree (this needs to be defined as a virtual function of the base class and defined in each derived class).  For the <code>HuffmanTreeNode</code> we return <code>left_child</code> if the character is '0' and <code>right_child</code> otherwise.  Although you need to define a function for the <code>HuffmanTreeLeaf</code> it should never get called.  You need to know whether you have reached a leaf.  A function <code>bool is_leaf()</code> and a second function <code>char symbol()</code> can be used do decode as follow
      <pre><code>
	  ifstream in_file(encoded_text_filename);
	  ofstream decompressed_file("decompressed_text.txt");
  
	  HuffmanTree* decoder = root;                   // start decoding at root of tree
	  while (in_file.get(ch)) {
	    decoder = decoder-&gt;decode(ch);              // navigate down tree depending on code
	    if (decoder-&gt;is_leaf()) {                   // when you hit a leaf use symbol
	      decompressed_file &lt;&lt; decoder-&gt;symbol();
	      decoder = root;                           // restart at root of tree
	    }
	  }
      </code></pre>
      (you need to define <code>bool is_leaf()</code> and <code>char symbol()</code> in the base class (as a virtual function) and the derived class&emdash;<code>char symbol()</code> will never be called for the <code>HuffmanTreeNode</code> class but you need to give it an implementation all the same)
     <li> Check that the decompressed file is identical to the original file (in Unix the command <code>diff file1 file2</code> checks the difference between two files)
  </ol>
  <p>Well done you have encoded and decoded a file using a Huffman code.  You got a long way with three data structures (maps, priority queues and you bespoke Huffman tree). In a real coding system you would have to store the Huffman tree in the encoded file.  For efficient compression you don&#39;t compress on characters, but on commonly occurring sub-strings.  You need to run another algorithm to identify the commonly occurring sub-strings.

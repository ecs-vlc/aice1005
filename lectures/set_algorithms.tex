\section[-2]{Equivalence Relations}
\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Given a set of elements $\mathcal{X}=\{x_1,\, x_2,\, \ldots \}$
    and a binary relationship $\sim$ with the following properties\pause
    \begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{(Reflexivity)}] For every element $x\in\mathcal{X}$,
      $x\sim x$\pause
    \item[\textbf{(Symmetry)}] For every two elements $x, y \in
      \mathcal{X}$ if $x \sim y$ then $y \sim x$\pause
    \item[\textit{(Transitivity)}] For every three elements $x, y, z \in
      \mathcal{X}$ if $x \sim y$ and $y\sim z$ then $x\sim z$\pause
    \end{description}
  \item Then $\sim$ defines a partitioning of the set into
    \emph{equivalence classes}

\section{Example of Equivalence Classes}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Although, equivalent classes sound very mathematical they
    often provide a useful formalisation of the real world\pause
  \item E.g. Pairs of web pages with a link in each direction between them\pause
  \item Consider web pages in the same equivalence class if you can
    get from one to the other by clicking links\pause
  \item Partitions the web into linked domains\pause
  \item Friendship relations in social media\pause

\section[-1]{Dynamic Equivalence Classes}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Finding equivalence classes is rather easy using graph traversal
    algorithms\pause
  \item However, as our web example suggests, there are applications
    where equivalence classes change over time\pause
  \item Adding a link could join two domains which were separate\pause
  \item We will see this is a useful idea both for building mazes
    and (in a later lecture) for finding minimum spanning trees\pause
  \item Building a data structure which finds equivalence classes where
    the equivalence relation changes over time is challenging\pause,
    but fortunately there is an elegant solution to this\pauseb

\begin{slide}
\section{Union-Find}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In the union-find algorithm we have a set of objects
    $x \in \mathcal{S}$ which are to be grouped into equivalence
    classes $\mathcal{S}_1$, $\mathcal{S}_2$, \ldots\pause
  \item Initially each object is in its own equivalence class\pause
  \item \emph{union} combines two equivalence classes\pause
  \item \emph{find} returns a unique member of the equivalence class
    (e.g $[a]$)\pause
  \item This is a common problem for which we will write a class
  \jl$DisjointSets$ to perform fast \texttt{union}s and \texttt{find}s\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section[-1]{DisjointSets}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We want to create a class
    \begin{java}
class DisjointSets
{
    DisjointSets(int numElements) {/* Constructor */}
    int find(int x) {/* Find root */}
    void union_(int root1, int root2) {/* Union */}

  private:
    int* s;
}$\pause$
    \end{java}
  \item Where \jl$find(x)$ returns a unique identifier for the subset
    which element \jl$x$ belongs to\pause
  \item The array \jl$s$ contains labelling information to implement
    \jl$find(x)$\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section[-1]{The Union-Find Dilemma}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A natural algorithm to perform finds is to maintain an
    array returning a subset label for each element\pause---this makes
    \texttt{find} fast\pause
  \item However, every time we combine two subset we have to change all
    the labels in this array (taking $O(n)$ operations)\pause
  \item If we are unlucky the cost of performing $n$ unions is
    $\Theta(n^2)$\pause
  \item If we ensure that we relabel the smaller subset then the time
    complexity is $\Theta(n \log(n))$\pause
  \item Fast \textit{finds} seems to give slow(ish) \textit{unions}\pause
  \item What about the other way around?\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section{Fast Union}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To achieve fast unions we can represent our disjoint sets as a
    forest (many disjoint trees)\pause
  \item Every time we perform a union we make one of the trees point to
    the head of the other tree\pause
  \item The cost of \texttt{find} depends on the depth of the tree\pause
  \item To make unions efficient we make the shallow tree a subtree of
    the deeper tree\pause

\section{Time Complexity of Union-Find}

\pb
\begin{itemize}
\item If we perform $M$ finds and $N$ unions then the time complexity
  is $O\bigl(M\log_2^*(N)\bigr)$\pauseh
\item Where $\log_2^*(N)$ is the number of times you need to apply the
  logarithm function before you get a number less than 1\pauseh
\item In practice $\log_2^*(N)\leq 5$ for all conceivable $N$\pauseh
  \begin{align*}
    \hspace{3cm}\log_2(10^{80}) = 265.75 \mypl{4}
    \mathllap{\log_2(\log_2(10^{80})) = 8.0539\mypl{5}}
    \mathllap{\log_2(\log_2(\log_2(10^{80}))) = 3.0097\mypl{6}}
    \mathllap{\log_2(\log_2(\log_2(\log_2(10^{80})))) = 1.5896\mypl{7}}
    \mathllap{\log_2(\log_2(\log_2(\log_2(\log_2(10^{80}))))) = 0.66868\pause}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Binary Search Trees: $O(\log_2(n))$, general purpose\pause
  \item Hash tables: $O(1)$, but need to compute hash, slow iterator
    when sparse, general purpose\pause
  \item B-trees: $O((k-1)\,\log_k(n))$ very complicated, used for large amounts
    of data\pause
  \item Tries: $O(len(seq))$ = $O(\log_k(n))$ for large $k$ expensive in memory,

\section{What Set to Use?}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A PhD student and I were working on writing a fast solver for a
    combinatorial optimisation problem\pause
  \item We had to choose one variable to change out of a small number of
    possible variables\pause
  \item Each time we changed a variable then we had to update the list
    of possible variables (remove some variables add others)\pause
  \item We wanted a data structure which had quick add and remove and
    where we could choose a variable at random\pause---what should we
    use?\pauseb

\section{Bounded Set}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item One special feature is that we knew we only wanted the set to
    contain integers between 0 and $n$ (where $n$ might be 100\,000)\pause
  \item This allowed us to use an array to represent whether an integer
    belong to that set\pause
  \item But how do we find a random element of the set quickly?\pause
  \item Use another array of course!\pauseb

  \item These data structures are not general purpose for solving every
    day problems (c.f. \jl$vector<T>$, \jl$set<T>$ and \jl$map<T>$)\pause
  \item They are ``back pocket'' data structures that solve problems
    that come up often enough that they are worth knowing about\pause

    mean they don't exist\pause
